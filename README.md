# RockPaperScissorsApp
Simply game based on original rock paper scissors, where player's goal is to select one of the three hand and win.

# Rules
"The winner of that round depends on the items formed. If the same item is formed, it's a tie. If a rock and scissors are formed, the rock wins, because a rock can smash scissors. If scissors and paper are formed, the scissors win, because scissors can cut paper. If paper and a rock are formed, the paper wins, because a sheet of paper can cover a rock. After one round is completed, another is begun. Play continues until one player reaches a predetermined score, or whenever the players' boredom is alleviated."(source: http://www.rinkworks.com/games/rps.shtml)
